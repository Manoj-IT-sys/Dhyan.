	<h2>Asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit just right for maximum damage</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="asteroid.jpg" class="image">
	<p class="lead">The trajectory of the asteroid thought to have killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was just right to cause maximum damage. A new study of Chicxulub crater in Mexico, where the asteroid struck, has revealed that the angle and speed of the impact were probably in the perfect range to send clouds of choking vapour into the skies.</p>
	<p class="lead">When an asteroid hits a planet, the resulting crater is highly dependent on the angle of the impact. Gareth Collins at Imperial College London in the UK and his colleagues compared a set of simulations with geological data gathered at Chicxulub crater to reconstruct that impact.</p>

	<p class="lead">“That initial impact gouges a huge hole in the ground, which then collapses spectacularly and you form this huge overshoot, rather like what happens when you throw a pebble into the pond,” says Collins. In this “overshoot”, the middle of the hole bounces back up to create a plateau at the centre of the crater.</p>

	<p class="lead">Much of the devastation caused by the asteroid impact came from vaporised rock being blasted into the air and blocking out sunlight. It turns out that an impact angle of about 60 degrees is ideal for hurling as much vapour into the air as possible, Collins says – if it came in from straight overhead, the asteroid would have smashed up more rock but not sent as much into the atmosphere, and if it was more of a glancing blow, less rock would have been vaporised.</p>

	<p class="lead">“It’s sort of a perfect storm,” says Collins, which is good news for us today. “This was a very bad day for the dinosaurs, and the more special the circumstances that had to come together to cause this event, the less likely that it’ll happen again.”</p>

	<h2>NASA’s Osiris-Rex Selects Target Asteroid Landing Site</h2>
	<br>

	<p class="lead">NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft left Earth in 2016, its sights set on an asteroid named Bennu that is as wide as the Empire State Building is tall. The robotic probe’s mission is to collect a sample from the surface of this space rock and bring it home to our planet, helping scientists understand more about the nascent days of our solar system, and possibly find clues to how life sprung up here on Earth.</p>

<p class="lead">But first the spacecraft’s controllers down here had to find a place for Osiris-Rex to land. On Thursday, after a difficult year of mapping its surface, they announced their target site at the 100th annual American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco. Named Nightingale, the area is near Bennu’s north pole and lies inside a small crater within a larger crater.</p>

<p class="lead">“We made our final decision based on which site has the greatest amount of fine-grained material and how easily the spacecraft can access that material while keeping the spacecraft safe,” said Dante Lauretta, the mission’s principal investigator and a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>

Dr. Lauretta also said that the site’s scientific value was high because of the northern latitude. Colder temperatures there mean more of the material the spacecraft collects could be preserved from when the asteroid first formed.</p>


<p class="lead">Bennu is one of a class of near Earth asteroids known as carbonaceous, because they are rich in carbon, organic material like hydrated minerals. It is thought to be one of the oldest rocks formed during the earliest days of the solar system, some four billion years ago. There is a small chance Bennu could collide with Earth, but not until the 22nd century should that occur. (The asteroid is too small to extinguish most life on Earth, but it would be catastrophic where it struck.)</p>

<p class="lead">Just over a year ago, after a journey of 1.2 billion miles, Osiris-Rex arrived at Bennu and quickly got to work examining the diamond shaped asteroid. As it sped closer, the team was hoping the surface would reveal large swaths of smooth terrain from which to collect a sample.</p>

<p class="lead">However, in true space exploration fashion nothing went as planned.</p>

<p class="lead">It turned out Bennu was covered in massive boulders stories high as well as other large rocks that posed a continuous challenge for site selection.</p>
