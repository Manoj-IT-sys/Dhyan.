<h2>The theory of How black hole grows.</h2>
<br>

			Astrophysicists  have developed a theoretical model for black holes to predict if growth by gas accretion or by merger is dominant.It’s valid, they say, from the local Universe up to redshift 10 (roughly from the present day to about 13 billion years ago) – and it suggests that the main growth channel depends on the mass of the black hole and on redshift.In the 
			nearby Universe small black holes grow mostly by accretion, while very big black holes grow mostly via mergers. In the very-far-away Universe, there is a reversal: small black holes grow mostly by mergers, big black holes by accretion.The 
			model is the work of Avi Loeb and Fabio Pacucci from the Centre for Astrophysics Harvard & Smithsonian . They presented their results at the virtual 236th meeting of the American Astronomical Society and also published a paper in The Astrophysical Journal.According to previous studies, black holes that grow mostly by accretion are predicted to rotate much faster on their axes than those that grow mostly via mergers.“As the rate of rotation, or spin, fundamentally affects the way the region around a black hole shines, studying the main growth modality of black holes helps to provide us with a clearer picture of how bright these sources can be,” Pacucci says.</p>
			
			<p class="lead">“We already know that matter falls toward the event horizon of black holes and, as it speeds up, it also heats up, and this gas starts to emit radiation. The more matter a black hole accretes, the brighter it is going to be; that’s why we’re able to observe far-away objects like supermassive black holes.
			“They’re one billion times more massive than the Sun, and they are able to emit enormous amounts of radiation so we can observe them from even billions of light years’ distance.”</p>
			

			<p class="lead">Loeb adds that even if their environment is gas-free, “black holes can grow in mass through galaxy mergers”.</p>

			<p class="lead">“We believe that every galaxy contains a massive black hole at its centre, which regulates the formation of stars in their host,” says Pacucci.</p>

			<p class="lead">“Understanding how black holes formed, grew and co-evolved with galaxies is fundamental to our understanding and knowledge of the universe, and with this study, we have one more piece of the puzzle.”
			Future observations will test the new model, the researchers say, because the next generation of space-based X-ray and gravitational wave observatories, including Lynx, Athena, AXIS and LISA – the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna – will be able to detect most of the black holes investigated in this work, up to the very early Universe.

			<h2>One Star's End is a Black Hole's Beginning</h2>
			<br>

			<p class="lead">Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon," time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.</p>

				Even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions. Soon after its launch in December 2004, NASA's Swift telescope observed the powerful, fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts. Chandra and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope later collected data from the event's "afterglow," and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide, producing another black hole.
